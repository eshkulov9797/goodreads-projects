<h1>Landing Page</h1>
<p>
    A landing page is a standalone web page created for a specific marketing campaign with the goal of driving a single, targeted action or conversion from a visitor. Unlike a website's general homepage, a landing page minimizes distractions like navigation menus and instead uses a focused message, compelling headlines, and a clear call to action (CTA) to encourage visitors to sign up for a service, make a purchase, download a resource, or provide contact information.
